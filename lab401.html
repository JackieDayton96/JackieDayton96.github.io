  <h1> WHOA! A web page!</h1>
  
  <p>This is my first web page for Web Mapping at MSU Denver. Boom.</p>
  
  <h3>About Me</h3>
  
  <h6>
    <p>I am a student at MSU Denver this semester working to get my GIS ccertificate! I find maps fascinating, and now that I have been working on creating them, I am even more enthralled! I am also a preschool teacher (which is stress central). I also have a big family and a dog and a cat. I am writing whatever comes into my mind because I get nervous talking about myself, but here we are.</p>
  
    <p> I am currently sitting at a Starbucks writing this, and it is very busy. I know, you're shocked. Starbucks, busy. Who'd have thought? There are some very cute dogs in here right now though, so I am enjoying myself immensely.</p>
  
    <p>I guess I didn't write too much about myself, but I do believe this web page has been insightful. Perhaps the next step in lab 4 will have more excitement from my end.</p>
