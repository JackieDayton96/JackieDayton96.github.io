  <h1> WHOA! A web page!</h1>
  
  <p>This is my THIRD web page for Web Mapping and my fourth lab at MSU Denver. Boom, boom.</p>
  
  <h3>About Me</h3>

  <h3>
    <p>I am a student at MSU Denver this semester working to get my GIS ccertificate! I find maps fascinating, and now that I have been working on creating them, I am even more enthralled! I am also a preschool teacher (which is stress central). I also have a big family and a dog and a cat. I am writing whatever comes into my mind because I get nervous talking about myself, but here we are. 
        I shall now put some information into a list for you. These are three activites that I love.</p>
<ul>
   <li>Reading</li>
   <li>Painting</li>
   <li>Jujutsu Kaisen :(</li>
</ul>
    
<h3><p> For my next trick, I shall attempt... (drumroll please) a table of all the animes I need to watch. It will probably never be finished and I will definitely not add the entire thing since it is very long.</p></h3>
       
      <table>
         <tr>
          <th>Anime Name</th>
          <th>Watch Status</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Vinland Saga  </td>
            <td>Watched</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Overlord  </td>
            <td>Unwatched</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Attack on Titan  </td>
             <td> One more painful part left</td>
        </tr>
     </table>
    
  <p> For my final tricks, I shall add a digital art piece I made when I was bored and a funny name generating website.</p>

  <p>I have written more information about myself. Please, hold the applause. I hope I have provided more entertainment.</p>
